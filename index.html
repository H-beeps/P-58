        <p class="para">My hobby is playing fun and engaging video games based on skill. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to comeplete any homework and then think about other video games I can play and design. I am 11 years old and I am in 6th grade. Now I like to draw a lot and play many sports in my backyard. Video games, game design, visual art, and sports are things I enjoy very much.All of these things usually keep me quite busy throughout the day. All of these hobbies of mine my friends also like to do with me, they all live very close so I get to visit them often and do these things with them!
